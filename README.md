# Union-Poll

Union-Poll is a Symfony 4 project I have worked on. The idea behind it is to make simple poll website that allows
Users to Vote on different polls.

## Functionality

Some features that the website has are for example. Any logged in user can create a new Poll.
Any logged in user can Vote.
Any Logged in user can comment on the Poll.
Admin users can edit any Votes, Delete users, delete polls.
While creating the Poll you are asked to Set time when the poll will expire.
Each Poll has to have certain amount of "LIKES" in order to be allowed to Vote on it
